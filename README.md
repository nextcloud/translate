# Translate
A Machine translation provider using Opus models by University of Helsinki running locally on CPU.

The models run completely on your machine. No private data leaves your servers.

Currently supported languages:

* English
* German
* French
* Spanish
* Chinese

Model size:

 * ~1GB per language pair
 * ~10GB in total

Requirements:

* x86 CPU
* GNU lib C (musl is not supported)

#### Nextcloud All-in-One:
With Nextcloud AIO, this app is not going to work because AIO uses musl. However you can use [this community container](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/local-ai) as replacement for this app.
